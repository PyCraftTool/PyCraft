Given that the initialization code must only involve `l2` and `l1`, the first test case is initialized by providing valid values for `l1` and `l2`. The assertion then verifies that the elements in `common` are equal to the common elements of `l1` and `l2`. \n\nThe second test case checks for an empty list `common` when `l2` is an empty list and `l1` has any values. Both initialization and assertions accounts for these edge case. \n\nThe third test case again uses an empty list for `common` since `l1` has floats values in it while `l1` tents toward using integers."
